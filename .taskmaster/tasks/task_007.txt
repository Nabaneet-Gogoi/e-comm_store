# Task ID: 7
# Title: Build Secure Checkout Flow with Stripe Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the multi-step checkout process (Shipping -> Payment -> Review). Integrate Stripe.js for secure client-side payment tokenization and implement a serverless function to create and confirm Stripe Payment Intents.
# Details:
Ensure PCI compliance by using Stripe's secure UI elements. Handle shipping address collection and display order summary before final confirmation.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct end-to-end testing of the checkout flow with test Stripe credentials. Verify successful payment processing and order creation in Sanity (if `order` schema is used for this).
