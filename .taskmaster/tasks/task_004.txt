# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Product Listing Page (PLP)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the visually rich Product Listing Page (PLP) UI. Display products in a minimalist grid layout. Implement client-side filtering and sorting options for categories, brands, and sizes.
# Details:
Utilize Next.js Image component for product images. Ensure responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop. Basic filtering should be instantaneous.

# Test Strategy:
Verify correct display of products. Test filtering and sorting functionality for accuracy and responsiveness. Check layout on different screen sizes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup PLP Page Structure and Basic Product Grid Display [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the main Product Listing Page (PLP) component and establish the basic minimalist grid layout. Fetch and display a static or mock list of product data, utilizing the Next.js Image component for product visuals.
### Details:
Create a new Next.js page for the PLP (e.g., `pages/products/index.js`). Define a simple array of mock product objects (id, name, imageUrl, category, brand, price, sizes). Render these products in a CSS Grid or Flexbox layout to achieve the minimalist grid. Ensure each product image uses `<Image>` from `next/image` with appropriate `width`, `height`, and `alt` props.

## 2. Implement Client-Side Filtering UI and Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop the user interface for filtering options (categories, brands, sizes) and implement the client-side JavaScript logic to filter the displayed products instantaneously based on user selections.
### Details:
Add filter controls (e.g., checkboxes, dropdowns) for categories, brands, and sizes to the PLP. Use React state to manage selected filters. Implement a client-side filtering function that takes the raw product data and the current filter selections, returning a filtered subset. Update the displayed products dynamically without page reloads. Ensure filtering is performant for a reasonable number of products.

## 3. Implement Client-Side Sorting UI and Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop the user interface for sorting options (e.g., by price, name) and implement the client-side JavaScript logic to sort the currently displayed products.
### Details:
Add a sorting control (e.g., a dropdown) with options like 'Price: Low to High', 'Price: High to Low', 'Name: A-Z'. Implement a client-side sorting function that takes the currently filtered product data and the selected sort order, returning a sorted array. Apply sorting to the products *after* filtering has been applied. Update the displayed products dynamically.

## 4. Ensure Responsiveness Across Devices [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Adapt the PLP layout, product grid, and filtering/sorting controls to be fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
### Details:
Utilize CSS media queries or a responsive framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap) to adjust the grid column count, spacing, font sizes, and filter/sort control placement for different breakpoints. Ensure product images scale appropriately and maintain aspect ratio. Test on various device emulators or actual devices.

## 5. Refine Performance and User Experience [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Optimize the client-side filtering and sorting for instantaneous response times and enhance the overall user experience of the PLP.
### Details:
Review the filtering and sorting logic for potential performance bottlenecks. Consider using `React.useMemo` to memoize filtered/sorted product lists to prevent unnecessary re-calculations. Implement a 'Clear All Filters' button. Ensure smooth transitions or state updates. Add accessibility considerations where applicable (e.g., ARIA attributes for filter controls).
