# Product Listing Page (PLP) Implementation

## Overview
The Product Listing Page provides a comprehensive interface for browsing products with advanced filtering and sorting capabilities. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, it offers a responsive and performant user experience.

## Features

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **Product Grid Display**: Minimalist grid layout with responsive design
- **Client-side Filtering**: Real-time filtering by categories, brands, and price range
- **Client-side Sorting**: Sort by name (A-Z/Z-A) and price (Low-High/High-Low)
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Performance Optimized**: Memoized filtering/sorting with React.useMemo

### ✅ Advanced Features
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens during data fetching
- **Empty States**: User-friendly messages when no products match filters
- **Filter Management**: Clear individual or all filters functionality
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with proper sizing
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application

### ✅ User Experience
- **Instant Feedback**: Real-time filtering without page reloads
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover states, transitions, and animations
- **Mobile-First**: Collapsible filters for mobile devices
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Product count, active filter indicators

## Component Architecture

### Main Components
- `ProductsPage`: Main page component with state management
- `ProductCard`: Reusable product display component
- `FilterSidebar`: Filter controls for categories, brands, and price
- `SortDropdown`: Sorting options component
- `ProductSkeleton`: Loading state components

### Data Flow
1. Fetch products, categories, and brands from Sanity CMS
2. Apply client-side filtering based on user selections
3. Sort filtered results according to user preference
4. Display results in responsive grid layout

## Performance Optimizations
- **Memoized Filtering**: Uses React.useMemo to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- **Image Optimization**: Proper sizing and lazy loading with Next.js Image
- **Component Splitting**: Modular components for better code organization
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript for runtime error prevention

## Responsive Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: 1 column (< 640px)
- **Tablet**: 2 columns (640px - 1024px)
- **Desktop**: 3-4 columns (> 1024px)
