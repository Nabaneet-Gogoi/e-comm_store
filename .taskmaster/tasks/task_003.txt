# Task ID: 3
# Title: Sanity Data Integration and API Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the data fetching layer in the Next.js frontend to interact with the Sanity API. Implement GROQ queries to retrieve product, category, and brand information efficiently.
# Details:
Create utility functions or hooks for fetching data. Consider server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) where appropriate for performance.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for data fetching functions. Verify that product, category, and brand data can be successfully retrieved and logged in the Next.js application.
