# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement User Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the secure user authentication system, enabling sign-up, login, and logout functionalities. This includes handling user sessions and secure credential management.
# Details:
Use a secure authentication system (e.g., NextAuth.js or custom solution with bcrypt for password hashing). Focus on security best practices.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login with valid/invalid credentials, and logout. Verify session management.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Authentication Framework and Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Select and integrate the chosen authentication framework (e.g., NextAuth.js) or set up a custom authentication structure. Define the user schema in the database, including fields for email, hashed password, and potentially roles/metadata.
### Details:
If using NextAuth.js, install it and configure the basic provider(s) (e.g., Credentials provider). If custom, set up bcrypt for password hashing and define the user model in your ORM/database. Ensure unique email constraint and appropriate indexing for user lookup.

## 2. Develop User Registration (Sign-Up) Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create an API endpoint and associated logic for new user registration. This involves receiving user credentials (email, password), hashing the password securely, and storing the user in the database.
### Details:
Implement input validation for email format and password strength. Use `bcrypt.hash` with a suitable salt rounds (e.g., 10-12) to securely hash passwords. Handle cases where an email already exists by returning an appropriate error. Ensure the endpoint is protected against common vulnerabilities like mass assignment.

## 3. Implement User Login and Session Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Develop the API endpoint and logic for user login. This involves verifying provided credentials against stored hashed passwords and, upon successful authentication, establishing a secure user session.
### Details:
Use `bcrypt.compare` to verify the provided password against the stored hash. If using NextAuth.js, configure the `signIn` function. If custom, generate a secure session token (e.g., JWT or server-side session ID) and store it securely (e.g., in an HTTP-only, secure cookie). Implement rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.

## 4. Develop User Logout Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Create an API endpoint and logic to allow authenticated users to log out. This involves invalidating or terminating the active user session.
### Details:
If using NextAuth.js, use the `signOut` function. If custom, clear the session cookie or invalidate the session token on the server-side. Ensure the logout process is robust and handles various session types (e.g., JWT expiration, server-side session destruction).

## 5. Implement Secure Session Management and Security Hardening [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Refine session management to ensure security and persistence. This includes implementing features like session expiration, refresh tokens (if applicable), and applying general security best practices across the authentication system.
### Details:
For NextAuth.js, configure session strategies (JWT vs. database), session expiry, and callbacks for token rotation. For custom solutions, implement token refresh mechanisms, secure cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax/Strict), and proper error handling to avoid information leakage. Consider CSRF protection for state-changing requests.
