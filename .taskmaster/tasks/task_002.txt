# Task ID: 2
# Title: Sanity CMS Schema and Initial Data Population
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Define and implement the Sanity.io content schemas for `product`, `category`, `brand`, and `order` data models. Populate the CMS with initial sample data for testing and development purposes.
# Details:
Define fields as per PRD: `product` (name, slug, brand, category, images, price, description, details, variants), `category` (name, slug), `brand` (name, logo), `order` (orderId, userEmail, items, totalAmount, shippingAddress, status).

# Test Strategy:
Verify that schemas are correctly defined in Sanity Studio. Confirm sample data can be created and viewed within the CMS.
